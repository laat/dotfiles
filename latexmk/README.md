# latexmk

Contains the alias `mkla` and config that I used during my master thesis. 

`cd` into the directory where the master.tex file is located, and run the alias
`mkla`. it will locate the correct texfile to build and rebuild as many times
as neccesary when you make changes (and saves). Evince will magically be
updated with the newest changes.
